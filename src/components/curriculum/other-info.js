        I am a person who likes to learn and overcome challenges, passionate
        about new tech- nologies and the digital age. I like sports, especially
        those that have to do with the sea and sailing. I also like to travel
        and meet new places, people and cultures. During the years I’ve been
        working as a kitesurf instructor. I’ve been able to travel to a lot of
        coun- tries in the world. I’m passionate about the sea and kitesurfing
        is my favourite hobby. I would like and I’m able to learn new skills and
        new languages, knowledge is every- thing. I really enjoy programming
        Javascript and especially with any of its frameworks Vue, React or
        Angular.
